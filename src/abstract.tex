Metallic aluminium plays a key role in our modern economy. Primary
metallic aluminium is produced by the transformation of aluminium
oxide with the Hall-HÃ©roult industrial process. This process, which
requires enormous energy quantities, consists in performing the
electrolysis of an aluminium oxide solute in large pots and with
hundreds of thousands of amperes of electrical current.

The topic of this thesis is the study of some selected aspects of the
modelisation of the electrolysis process from the point of view of
numerical simulation. This thesis is split in two parts.

The first part is focused on the numerical modelisation of the alumina
powder dissolution and transport in the electrolytic bath as a
function the the bath temperature.
