abstract = {A new equation is presented for sediment fall velocity as a function of grain diameter for given values of fluid viscosity and fluid and solid density. Sediment fall velocity is a fundamental parameter in the modeling and interpretation of fluviatile and coastal deposition. The equation applies to the entire range of viscous to turbulent conditions, and its simple explicit form makes it easy to use in computer models and other applications in sedimentology, geomorphology, and engineering. The equation is derived from dimensional analysis and converges on Stokes' law for small grains and a constant drag coefficient for large grains. Its two physically interpretable parameters are easily adjusted for shape effects or for the use of sieve diameter rather than nominal grain diameter. It gives a close fit to published and new experimental data for both quartz sand and low-density materials, with no more error than previous equations of more complicated form.},

In order to achieve such impressive step change, management of alumina dissolution is a key point to optimize both cell design and process control algorithms.},

For each class of schemes, theoretical and numerical convergence results available in the literature are reviewed and open questions are discussed. The essential results are summarized in a table which could serve as a useful reference to numerical analysts and practitioners.},

abstract = {A new finite element formulation for convection dominated flows is developed. The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100. ?? 1982.},

Discretization in space is performed by the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin method and in time we use an A-stable finite difference operator.

Uniform stability of the general formulation is proved under a regularity condition on data, or a moderate inverse CFL-condition that allows for optimal choices of the discretization parameters. Both the backward Euler method (BDF1), the Crank-Nicolson scheme and the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) enter the framework and quasi-optimal convergence is proved for these schemes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The main abrasive in contact with the cathode blocks is the sludge but, to cause wear, it would have to have considerable mobility. Sludge also introduces a resistance to the current flow path since it has been shown that on some occasions it covers significant fractions of cathode surfaces.",
