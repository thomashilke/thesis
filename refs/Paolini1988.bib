abstract = {An efficient implementation of finite element methods for free boundary parabolic problems in general two dimensional space domains is presented. The Stefan problem, the Hele-Shaw problem and the porous medium equation are included. Backward differences or linearization techniques are used for the time discretization of the problem. The performances of these schemes are discussed with several numerical tests.},
