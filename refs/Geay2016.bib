abstract="There has been growing concern on cathode wear in modern aluminium smelting cells, with doubts existing on the mechanistic causes. The dissolution of carbide has been shown to be an important factor, but there have been suggestions that abrasive wear is also a major contributor. The main abrasive in contact with the cathode blocks is the sludge but, to cause wear, it would have to have considerable mobility. Sludge also introduces a resistance to the current flow path since it has been shown that on some occasions it covers significant fractions of cathode surfaces.",
