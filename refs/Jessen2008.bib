abstract = {Aluminum reduction cells are used to produce aluminum by electrolysis of aluminum oxide, a process known as the Hall-H{\'{e}}roult process. Due to a limiting number of operational parameters that can be measured in an operating cell, the dynamics of the process are not fully understood and cell operation based largely on experience. In this work, the principles of the Hall-H{\'{e}}roult process are presented and a mathematical model developed to predict the dynamic behavior of an aluminum reduction cell. The model is based on an existing cell design which is currently being used at Nor√∞ur{\'{a}}l reduction plant in Iceland, and measurements data gathered from an operating cell for model validation. The model is constructed in three parts; a material balance model, a cell voltage model and a thermal balance model. The three parts are then combined into one overall cell model which may aid in the future improvements in control strategies and cell operation, as well as developing a predictive tool for the process itself.
