abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society. All rights reserved.In the last decade, the cell productivity has been dramatically improved as demonstrated on AP30 technology with amperage increase from 350 kA to 440 kA. At the same time, available liquid bath volume in the pots has been drastically reduced by the anode surface enlargement. In order to achieve such impressive step change, management of alumina dissolution is a key point to optimize both cell design and process control algorithms.},
