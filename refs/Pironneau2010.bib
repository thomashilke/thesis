abstract = {SUMMARY A Galerkin-characteristics finite element scheme of lumped mass type is presented for the convection– diffusion problems. Under the weakly acute triangulation hypothesis the scheme is proved to be stable and convergent in the L ∞ -norm. Using the Freefem, we show 2D and 3D numerical examples, which reflect the robustness of the scheme and the theoretical convergence result.},
